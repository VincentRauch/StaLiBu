\[C] So, so you think you can \[D]tell
heaven from \[Am]hell, blue skies from \[G]pain.
Can you tell a green \[D]field from a cold steel \[C]rail?
A smile from a \[Am]veil? Do you think you can \[G]tell?

\beginverse
Did they get you to \[C]trade your heroes for \[D]ghosts?
Hot ashes for \[Am]trees? Hot air for a \[G]cool breeze?
Cold comfort for \[D]change? Did you ex\[C]change
a walk-on part in the \[Am]war for a lead role in a \[G]cage?

\beginchorus
\[C] How I wish, how I wish you were \[D]here.
We're just \[Am]two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl,\[G] year after year.
\[D] Running over the same old grounds,\[C] what have we found?
The same old \[Am]fears, wish you were \[G]here.
