^ Another mo^ther's breaking he^art is taking o^ver.
^ When the violence c^auses silence, ^we must be mista^ken.
It's the s^ame old theme since ^1916, in your h^ead, in your head, they're still figh^ting
with their tanks^ and their bombs, and their bombs^ and their guns.
In your h^ead, in your head, they are dy^ing.
