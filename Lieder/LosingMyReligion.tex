\endverse

\beginverse \memorize
Oh \[Am]life is bigger, \[Em] it's bigger than you
And you are \[Am]not me, the lengths that I will \[Em]go to
The distance in your \[Am]eyes
\[Em] Oh no I've said too \[Dm]much, I set it up \[G]
\endverse

\beginverse
That's me in the cor^ner, that's me in the spot^light
Losing my reli^gion, trying to ^keep up with you
And I ^don't know if I can do it
^ Oh no I've said too ^much, I haven't said e^nough
\endverse

\beginchorus
I thought that I heard you lau\[F]ghing
I thought that I \[G]heard you \[Am]sing
I \[F]think I thought I saw \[G]you try\[Am] \[G]
\endchorus 

\beginverse
Every whi^sper, of every waking ^hour
I'm choosing my con^fessions, trying to ^keep an eye on you
Like a ^hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
^ Oh no I've said too ^much, I set it up ^
\endverse

\beginverse
Consider ^this, consider this the ^hint of the century
Consider ^this the slip that ^brought me to my knees, failed
^What if all these fantasies come^ flailing around
Now I've ^said too much ^
\endverse

\beginverse*
But that was just a dream
That was just a dream
\endverse

\beginverse
That's me in the corner, that's me in the spot-light
Losing my religion, trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've said too much
I haven't said enough
\endverse

\printchorus

\beginverse*
But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try
That was just a dream, just a dream
Just a dream, dream
\endverse
