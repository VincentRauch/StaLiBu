Your ^beauty is be^yond compare with ^flaming locks of ^auburn hair,
with ^ivory skin and ^eyes of emerald ^green.
Your ^smile is like a ^breath of spring your ^voice is soft like ^summer rain,
and ^I can not com^pete with you, Jo^lene.
\endverse

\beginverse
He ^talks about you ^in his sleep and there's ^nothing I can ^do to keep,
From ^crying when he ^calls your name, Jo^lene.
Now ^I can easily ^understand how ^you could easily ^take my man,
but you ^don't know what he ^means to me, Jo^lene...

And what^ever you de^cide to do, Jo^lene...
