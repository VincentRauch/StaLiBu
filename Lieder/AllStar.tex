\beginverse\memorize
Some\[D]body once \[A]told me the \[Em]world is gonna \[G]roll me,
I \[D]ain’t the sharpest \[A]tool in the \[Em]shed. \[G]
She was \[D]looking kind of \[A]dumb with her \[Em]finger and her \[G]thumb,
with the \[D]shape of an \[A]''L'' on her \[Em]forehead.\[G]
~
Well the \[D]years start coming and they \[A]don’t stop coming,
\[Em]Fed to the rules and I \[G]hit the ground running.
\[D]Didn’t make sense not to \[A]live for fun,
your \[Em]brain gets smart and your \[G]head gets dumb.
\[D]So much to do, so \[A]much to see, so what’s 
\[Em]wrong with taking the \[G]back streets?
You’ll \[D]never know if you don’t \[A]go, you’ll \[Em]never shine if you don’t \[G]glow!
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[D]Hey now you’re an \[A]All Star, get your \[Em]game on, \[G]go play!
\[D]Hey now you’re a \[A]Rock Star, get the \[Em]show on \[G]get paid!
And \[D]all that \[A]glitters is \[Hm]gold, \[G]only shooting \[D]stars \[C]break the \[G]mold.
\endchorus

\beginverse
It’s a ^cool place and they ^say it gets colder,
you’re ^bundled up now, wait ^’till you get older.
but the ^meteor men beg a ^differ judging by the 
^hole in the satellite ^picture.
\newpage
The ice we ^skate is getting pretty ^thin 
the water’s getting ^warm so you might as well ^swim
My world’s on ^fire how about ^yours that’s the way I 
^like it and I never get ^bored

Some^body once ^asked ''Could I ^spare some change for ^gas,
I need to ^get myself aw^ay from this ^place.'' ^
I said ^''Yep, what a con^cept, I could ^use a little fuel my^self
and we could ^all use a ^little ^change.'' ^
