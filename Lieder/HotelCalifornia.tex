\beginverse
\[Hm] On a dark desert highway,\[F#7] cool wind in my hair.
\[A] Warm smell of colitas\[E] rising up through the air.
\[G] Up ahead in the distance,\[D] I saw a shimmering light.
\[Em] My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim,\[F#] I had to stop for the night.

\[Hm] There she stood in the doorway,\[F#7] I heard the mission bell.
\[A] And I was thinking to myself this could be \[E]heaven or this could be hell.
\[G] Then she lit up a candle,\[D] and she showed me the way.
\[Em] There were voices down the corridor,\[F#] I thought I heard them say:
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[G] Welcome to the Hotel Cali\[D]fornia.
Such a \[F#7]lovely place \echo{such a lovely place} such a \[Hm]lovely face.
\[G]Plenty of room at the Hotel Cali\[D]fornia.
Any \[Em]time of year \echo{any time of year} you can \[F#]find it here.
\endchorus 

\beginverse
^ Her mind is Tiffany-twisted,^ she got the Mercedes Benz.
^ She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys,^ she calls friends.
^ How they dance in the courtyard, ^sweet summer sweat.
^ Some dance to remember,^ some dance to forget.

^ So I called up the Captain,^ 'Please bring me my wine'. He said,
^ 'We haven't had that spirit here since^ nineteen sixty nine'.
^ And still those voices are calling from ^far away,
^ wake you up in the middle of the night,^ just to hear them say:
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[G] Welcome to the Hotel Cali\[D]fornia.
Such a \[F#7]lovely place \echo{such a lovely place}, such a \[Hm]lovely face.
They're \[G]livin' it up at the Hotel Cali\[D]fornia.
What a \[Em]nice surprise \echo{what a nice surprise} bring your \[F#]alibis.
\endchorus

\beginverse
^ Mirrors on the ceiling,^ the pink champagne on ice. And she said,
^ 'We are all just prisoners here,^ of our own device'.
^ And in the master's chambers,^ they gathered for the feast.
^ They stab it with their steely knives, but they ^just can't kill the beast.

^ Last thing I remember, I was^ running for the door.
^ I had to find the passage back to the ^place I was before.
^ 'Relax,' said the night man, 'we are^ programmed to receive.
^ You can check out any time you like,^ but you can never leave!'
\endverse
