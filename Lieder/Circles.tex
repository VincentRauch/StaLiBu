\[G]Round and a\[D]round and a\[C]round turns the \[G]good earth;
all things must \[D]change as the \[C]seasons \[D]go \[G]by.
We are the \[D]children of the \[C]Lord and the \[G]Lady,
whose mysteries we \[D]know but we \[C]never \[D]know why. \[G]

\beginverse
\[G]In all lands the \[D]people have \[C]tried to the \[G]good earth,
ploughing and \[D]sawing as the \[C]seasons \[D]de\[G]clared,
waiting to \[D]reap of the \[C]rich golden \[G]harvest,
knowing their \[D]joy in the \[C]laughs that \[D]they \[G]shared.
